Kalah AI implementation in C made for the course DV2557 Applied Artificial Intelligence at Blekinge Institute of Technology. The grade attempted is a B.

This is only the AI, it communicates with a game server according to a defined protocol. The AI uses the minimax algorithm with iterative deepening and alpha-beta pruning.

Compiled using Visual Studio 2013 and Visual Studio 2012. The solution files can be generated using premake, via the commands: 'premake vs2013' or 'premake vs2012'. This will place the solution files in the 'build' directory.
